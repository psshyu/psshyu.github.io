## Introduction

Hi, I'm Skylar. I'm currently studying computer science at the [University of Utah](www.cs.utah.edu)
while working as a Campus Web Hosting intern under the [sUdo program.](sudo.utah.edu) I utilize
Python heavily at work, mostly to pull metrics to oversee the health of the webhosts supporting the
University of Utah's websites. 

My areas of interest within computer science are automation and data analytics, with the goal of
ultimately standardizing processes and eliminate the human overhead cost associated with performing
repetitive tasks, as well as create prediction models to forecast changes.

Outside of work and academics, I enjoy playing city builder games and running around as a tank in
every RPG I find. A perfect Sunday afternoon would involve watching my Boston Bruins win a game,
sampling the lastest tea I've bought from yet another fancy-schmancy teahouse-- all the while knowing
that a rib-eye steak will be served for dinner.
