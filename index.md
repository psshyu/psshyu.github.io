## Introduction

Hello! I'm currently studying computer science at the [University of Utah](www.cs.utah.edu). During the school
year, I work as a Campus Web Hosting intern under the [sUdo program.](sudo.utah.edu) I utilize
Python heavily at work, mostly to pull metrics to oversee the health of the webhosts supporting the
University of Utah's websites. 

This past summer, I had the opportunity to work at Symantec as a Software Engineer intern. I was tasked with
automating the continuous intergration testing for their [Content Analysis System](www.symantec.com/content/dam/symantec/docs/solution-briefs/content-analysis-en.pdf).
In addition, I produced a website framework to visualize test results using a combination of D3, Tornado, Nginx, Jenkins, and Supervisord. 

My areas of interest within computer science are automation and data analytics, with the goal of
standardizing processes and eliminate the human overhead cost associated with performing
repetitive tasks, as well as create prediction models to forecast changes. I gravitate toward
web development projects as I was exposed to web design at a young age (way back in 1999). 

Outside of academics and computer science in general, I satiate my OCD-ness with games such as Cities: Skylines 
and Oxygen Not Included while listening to JRPG soundtracks. I'm a huge sneakerhead and own 30+ pairs of deadstock 
Air Jordan Is and IIIs. In another world, I would be an essayist; in reality, I just binge on fanfiction.
